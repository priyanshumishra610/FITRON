## 🚀 What is FITRON?

**FITRON** is the world's first **AI-powered fitness OS** that does what no other app does:
- Tracks **every single rep**
- Detects bad form, unsafe loads, ego-lifting
- Locks your plan when you're reckless
- Provides an AI + Human Trainer fallback
- Maps your **Goal Physique** with celebrity-inspired blueprints
- Updates your training daily using **ZenML pipelines**

---

## 🔥 Why FITRON is 10X Smarter

✅ **Pose. Precision. Progress.**  
OpenCV + YOLO + SAM + Mediapipe deliver second-by-second pose, rep speed, range of motion, and fatigue signals.

✅ **Ego-Proof Your Lifts.**  
Auto-regulation logic detects when you're pushing past safe limits, locks risky sets, and adjusts your weights instantly — no injury, no excuses.

✅ **Celebrity Physique Roadmap.**  
*"Want Salman Khan's chest? Arnold's arms? Bruce Lee's core?"*  
FITRON reverse-engineers iconic physiques using CLIP embeddings and physique databases, then plots a data-driven plan, ETA, and daily adjustments.

✅ **Per-Rep Heatmap (Pro).**  
Every rep scored, stored, visualized. Trainers can watch your sticking points and break your plateau in real-time.

✅ **Human + AI Hybrid Coaching.**  
AI does the grunt work — live posture correction, diet tweaks, micro-loading. Pro unlocks your personal human trainer for form checks, overrides, and accountability.

✅ **Fully Autonomous Pipelines.**  
Powered by **ZenML**, your entire fitness data graph — sets, reps, form, fatigue, sleep, nutrition — flows into a smart loop that rewrites your plan every day.

## 🧩 What Makes FITRON Unbeatable?

- 🔍 **Real Rep Intelligence:** Not just set counting — every rep velocity, angle, and cheat detected.
- 🧠 **True Goal Matching:** Don't settle for generic "bulking plans" — get a bespoke blueprint for *your genetics, your timeline, your dream physique*.
- 🎥 **Train Like a Pro:** Upload your lift → get AI overlays → get coach feedback → fix form → get stronger → repeat.
- 🌐 **Trainer Marketplace:** (Coming Soon) Trainers publish plug-ins for martial arts, powerlifting, sports-specific drills. Earn while your AI module runs.
